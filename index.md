# Introduction

Group Sense detects patterns in group chat message streams and transforms them into self-contained queries for downstream AI systems. While single-user AI assistants excel at responding to direct queries, they struggle with multi-party conversations where relevant information emerges from complex exchanges between multiple participants. Group Sense solves this by acting as an intelligent adapter that monitors group conversations, identifies meaningful patterns, and reformulates them into queries that existing AI assistants can process, enabling proactive and "overhearing" AI assistance without requiring the underlying assistant to understand group dynamics or multi-party dialogue structure.
