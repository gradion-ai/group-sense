  Hey everyone! How was your weekend?

Message 1 (user_2):
  Pretty good! Went hiking with my family. Weather was perfect.

Message 2 (user_3):
  Nice! I mostly stayed in and caught up on some reading.

Message 3 (user_4):
  I went to that new brewery downtown. Highly recommend it!

Message 4 (user_1):
  So about the Q4 project deadline... are we still on track?

Message 5 (user_2):
  I think we're in good shape. The API integration is about 80% complete.

Message 6 (user_3):
  That's great news. What about the frontend work?

Message 7 (user_4):
  Frontend is done except for the dashboard widgets. Should finish those by Wednesday.

Message 8 (user_1 -> user_4):
  user_4, do you need any help with the widgets? I can jump in if needed.

  Thanks! I might take you up on that. Let me see how far I get today.

Message 10 (user_2):
  We should also schedule a testing session before the release.

  Good idea. How about Friday afternoon?

Message 12 (user_1):
  Friday works for me.

  Yeah! What are you thinking?

Message 20 (user_2):
  Quick question - can someone review my pull request when you get a chance? It's the authentication refactor.

Message 21 (user_1):
  I can take a look. What's the PR number?

Message 22 (user_2):
  It's PR #247. Main changes are in the auth middleware and user session handling.

Message 23 (user_1 -> user_2):
  user_2, I'm seeing some issues with the token refresh logic. Are you using the new JWT library?

Message 24 (user_2 -> user_1):
  Yes, I upgraded to v3.2. What issues are you seeing?

Message 25 (user_1):
  The refresh tokens aren't being validated correctly. They're expiring too early.

Message 26 (user_2):
  Hmm, I think I might have misconfigured the expiration time. Let me check the docs.

Message 27 (user_4):
  I had the same issue last month. You need to set the refresh_expiry parameter separately from the access_expiry.

Message 28 (user_2 -> user_4):
  user_4, do you remember what values you used?

Message 29 (user_4 -> user_2):
  I set access_expiry to 15 minutes and refresh_expiry to 7 days. Worked perfectly after that.

Message 30 (user_2):
  That makes sense. I'll update the config and push a new commit. Thanks!

Message 31 (user_1):
  Also, you might want to add some unit tests for the token refresh flow. I noticed there aren't any in the PR.

Message 32 (user_2):
  Good catch. I'll add those before merging.

Message 33 (user_3):
  By the way, has anyone seen the new office renovation plans? They're putting in a coffee bar!

Message 34 (user_4):
  Really? That's awesome! When is that happening?

Message 35 (user_3):
  I think construction starts next month. They sent an email about it last week.
